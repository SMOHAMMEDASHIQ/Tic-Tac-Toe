# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Python for the backend.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay: Players take turns marking spaces with "X" and "O".
- Dynamic updating: The game board and current player are updated in real-time as players make moves.
- Win detection: The game automatically detects and announces the winner when a player achieves a winning combination.
- Draw detection: The game recognizes and declares a draw when all spaces are filled without a winner.
- Animated text: The title alternates between "Tic Tac Toe" and "Tic Tac" every 2 seconds, adding visual interest to the game.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start the game.
2. Click on an empty space in the grid to make a move.
3. The game will continue until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
